{"tagline":"Set of tools and utilities (command line, GUI, Mac Service) to transform NIB files for the iPhone into Objective-C code files","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"nib2objc - NIB to Objective-C converter\r\n=======================================\r\n\r\nThis utility converts NIB files (or XIB ones) into Objective-C code,\r\nincluding all the properties of each instance, the documented\r\nconstructor calls, and also the view hierarchy. It uses the output of\r\nthe ibtool utility bundled with the Xcode tools. For more information\r\nabout ibtool, please check [the ibtool man\r\npage](http://developer.apple.com/DOCUMENTATION/DARWIN/Reference/ManPages/man1/ibtool.1.html).\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nCompile and put the utility in your path, and then call\r\n\r\n    nib2objc yourfile.xib > code.m\r\n\r\nThis will generate a file with the output of the conversion, similar to\r\nthis (check out the included sample.m file for the full version):\r\n\r\n        // ...\r\n        UIView *view6 = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 460.0)];\r\n        view6.frame = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 320.0, 460.0);\r\n        view6.alpha = 1.000;\r\n        view6.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight;\r\n        view6.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithWhite:0.750 alpha:1.000];\r\n        view6.clearsContextBeforeDrawing = NO;\r\n        // ...\r\n\r\n        UIButton *button9 = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];\r\n        button9.frame = CGRectMake(167.0, 65.0, 72.0, 37.0);\r\n        button9.adjustsImageWhenDisabled = YES;\r\n        button9.adjustsImageWhenHighlighted = YES;\r\n        button9.alpha = 1.000;\r\n        button9.autoresizingMask = UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleRightMargin | UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleBottomMargin;\r\n        button9.clearsContextBeforeDrawing = NO;\r\n        button9.clipsToBounds = NO;\r\n        button9.contentHorizontalAlignment = UIControlContentHorizontalAlignmentCenter;\r\n        // ...\r\n        [button9 setTitleShadowColor:[UIColor colorWithWhite:0.000 alpha:1.000] forState:UIControlStateSelected];\r\n\r\n        // ...\r\n        [view6 addSubview:button9];\r\n        // ...\r\n\r\nThe generated code takes into account the real class hierarchies in the\r\nUIKit, and it outputs the correct constructors and/or method calls for\r\neach object, depending on its class, including the enum values\r\ncorresponding to the properties using them.\r\n\r\nMac OS X GUI Application\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThe “GUI” folder contains a Mac OS X application that can be used to\r\nopen several nib files and to see their contents as Objective-C code.\r\n\r\nThe GUI application uses the\r\n[Fragaria](http://github.com/mugginsoft/Fragaria) library as a\r\nsubmodule, to provide syntax highlighting of the generated Objective-C\r\ncode. Prior to compilation, please do the following:\r\n\r\n    $ git submodule init\r\n    $ git submodule update\r\n\r\nMac OS X Service\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nA secondary project in the “Convert with nib2objc” folder creates an\r\nAutomator action, that can be used to create Mac OS X services with\r\nAutomator. The “Convert with nib2objc.zip” file contains an example of\r\nsuch a service, ready to be installed in \\~/Library/Services, and which\r\ncan be called from the Finder after selecting a nib file. The result of\r\nthe conversion will be placed in the clipboard for pasting into any\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n-   For the moment this utility only works for UIKit views (iPhone), but\r\n    it should be easy to extend to those of the AppKit too.\r\n-   It cannot output the values of UIImage, NSLocale or NSTimeZone\r\n    properties, because ibtool does not support them.\r\n-   It does not distinguishes default values for properties, and as\r\n    such, it outputs all the information it can find about a particular\r\n    instance.\r\n\r\n### Contributions\r\n\r\nThis project includes the **nibs2objc.pl** Perl script by Rudi Farkas,\r\nwhich allows users to perform batch transformations of nib files in a\r\nfolder. Thanks Rudi for the contribution!\r\n","name":"nib2objc","google":""}
